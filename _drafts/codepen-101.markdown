[Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) is a revolutionary web IDE. What that essentially means is that you can code a webpage, complete with CSS and Javascript, all in your browser, without having to install anything. How cool is that?

Beyond that, the coolest thing about Codepen is its ability to show you what your code does. When you, say, change the background color, the preview automatically refreshes and shows you the changes. It's super great for understanding the effects of your own code.

However, working on [30 Days, 30 Sites](http://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites) has brought to light a bitter reality: the true powers of Codepen have not yet been realized by a lot of people. A lot of you have been asking for help because your code works locally, but not on Codepen.

Codepen can be hard to wrestle with. Here's a little tutorial on how to use Codepen. We'll be building a really simple webpage, with minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## TL;DR:
### Steps to creating a new webpage:
1. [Creating the pen](#step-1)
2. [Hack away](#step-2) in the HTML, CSS, and JS editors
3. [Save and rename](#step-3) your pen
(optional)4. Add your new pen to a [collection](#step-4)

Now, before we begin, let's make some things clear:

[Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) is a revolutionary web IDE. What that essentially means is that you can code a webpage, complete with CSS and Javascript, all in your browser, without having to install anything. How cool is that?

Beyond that, the coolest thing about Codepen is its ability to show you what your code does. When you, say, change the background color, the preview window automatically refreshes and shows you the changes. It's super great for understanding the consequences of your own code.

However, working on [30 Days, 30 Sites](http://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites) has proven one thing: y'all don't know jack shit about Codepen. So let me sit you down and learn you a thing. 

Steps to creating a new webpage:
1. Create an account and log in. 
2. Click "Create"
3. Hack away in the HTML, CSS, and JS windows
4. Click "Save"
5. Change the name of your pen
(optional)6. Add your new pen to a collection

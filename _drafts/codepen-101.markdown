[Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) is a revolutionary web IDE. What that essentially means is that you can code a webpage, complete with CSS and Javascript, all in your browser, without having to install anything. How cool is that?

Beyond that, the coolest thing about Codepen is its ability to show you what your code does. When you, say, change the background color, the preview automatically refreshes and shows you the changes. It's super great for understanding the effects of your own code.

However, working on [30 Days, 30 Sites](http://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites) has brought to light a bitter reality: the true powers of Codepen have not yet been realized by a lot of people. A lot of you have been asking for help because your code works locally, but not on Codepen.

Codepen can be hard to wrestle with. Here's a little tutorial on how to use Codepen. We'll be building a really simple webpage, with minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## TL;DR:
### Steps to creating a new webpage:
1. [Creating the pen](#step-1)
2. [Hack away](#step-2) in the HTML, CSS, and JS editors
3. [Save and rename](#step-3) your pen
(optional)4. Add your new pen to a [collection](#step-4)

# Terminology
Now, before we begin, let's make some things clear:

## Pens
What's a pen? It's basically Codepen's fancy word for a webpage. Codepen calls "projects" full fledged websites that can contain data files, multiple assets, and multiple HTML files, etc.

## Editors

Editors are surrounded by the blue squares. There are 3 different editors: one for HTML, one for CSS, and the other one is - you guessed it - for JavaScript.

You know how we'd put HTML, CSS, and JS code in different files? This is the same concept. Instead of files, we put them in their own editors.

## Settings 
The little gear buttons surrounded by the brown boxes are where your settings live. Here's what you can do with the settings: 
* HTML:

    * Use a preprocessor - if you want to use HAML, Pug, etc, this is where you tell Codepen! Then, there's literally nothing else to do - just code in the preprocessor language you chose.  
    * Add a class to HTML - sometimes you need to add styling to your HTML tag. Here's where you put it.  
    * Put stuff in the <head> - Codepen is set up so that you won't need to add your <head>, <meta>, <link>, and <script> tags in the HTML editor. Just add the <meta> stuff in the settings, and the <link> and <script> links in the CSS or JavaScript settings.  
* CSS

    * Preprocessors - so SASS, LESS, that kind of good stuff.
    * CSS Base and Vendor Prefixing selections
    * Add external CSS - here's where you paste the CDN links of the CSS you want to use. For example, I imported the Bootstrap and MDBootstrap CDNs here. So there's no need for you to use a <link> tag in the HTML editor!  
    Click the Quick Add to view a dropdown of some of the most popular CSS links like Bootstrap and Foundation, so you  don't have to manually copy-and-paste them.

* JavasScript:

    * Use a preprocessor like Babel or Coffeescript
    * Add external JS files like JQuery, Angular, and Vue. Use the Quick Add dropdown to quickly add some of the more popular frameworks.

* Behavior - deals with the behavior of this current pen.
    * Code indentation - basically how many spaces would appear if you pressed "tab"
    * Autosave - Codepen saves your code every once in a while. Toggle to turn it on or off.
    * Auto-updating preview - Codepen automatically reads your new code and then displays them in the preview every time you stop typing.  
    Toggle to turn this on or off. You want to turn this off if you're working on the pen for a long time, because Codepen can get flaky if you don't - it's a browser cache thing.

# What is Git?

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in your files, that's it! Now take that and tie it into GitHub. You take your tracked files, and push them to the cloud (github), now your version is saved and backed up on the  "cloud". Since your files are on the cloud, you or anyone else you want to work with, can use these files on any computer.
